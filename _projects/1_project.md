This is my final project in UoS and future work for CLML.

I will investigate about effect of Cosmic Web structure when I use machine learning algorithm in predicting cosmological paramters.

The meaning of *SCOPE* is **Structure-based Cosmological Parameter Estimation** (made by Chat_GPT!)

The catch-phrase of this work is *Let's enlarge our scope*

I drew logo in three versions. Which one do you like most?
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/scope_logo_all.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
