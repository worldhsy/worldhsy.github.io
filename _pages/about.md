Welcome to my page!
My name is Se Yeon Hwang, and I graduated with a master's degree from the Department of Physics at the University of Seoul in August 2023.
During my master's program, I studied cosmology and the large-scale structure of the universe using statistical methods and machine learning. The topic of my master's thesis was "Leveraging Machine Learning to Estimate Cosmological Parameters from Large Scale Structure of the Universe," and the content is currently available in the archive.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
