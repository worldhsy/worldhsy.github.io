Welcome to my page!

My name is Se Yeon Hwang, and I graduated with a master's degree from the Department of Physics at the University of Seoul in August 2023.

During my master's program, I studied Cosmology and the Large Scale Structure of the Universe using statistical methods (n-point correlation function) and machine learning. 

The topic of my master's thesis was "Leveraging Machine Learning to Estimate Cosmological Parameters from Large Scale Structure of the Universe," and the paper in under publish process. [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08192)
